# draw.io binding contract

Schema version: **1**.

This document is the interface between the portograph draw.io export and the tools that read it,
for example a Grafana panel that binds cells to Prometheus series. A reader can depend on each
rule in this document. A change to a rule increments the schema version.

## 1. File format

- The export is one plain, uncompressed XML file: `<mxfile host="portograph"><diagram id="pg-diagram" name="…"><mxGraphModel>…`.
- The root cell (`id="0"`) is a draw.io `UserObject`. It carries `pg-schema="1"`.
- A bound cell is an `<object>` element around an `<mxCell>`. The `<object>` holds the cell `id`,
  the `label` (the old `value`) and the binding attributes. The inner `<mxCell>` holds `style`,
  `vertex` or `edge`, `parent`, `source`, `target` and the geometry. It has no `id` and no `value`.
- All other cells (groups, icon tiles, legend, overlay marks, layers) are bare `<mxCell>`
  elements, as before. A mesh bus piece and a text cell that only needs a `tooltip` are an `<object>`
  with `tooltip` and no `pg-kind`. Such an `<object>` is not a binding; a reader keys on `pg-kind`.

```xml
<object id="pg-port~sw1~eth2~1" label="eth2" pg-kind="port" pg-id="sw1:eth2"
        pg-node="sw1" pg-port="eth2" ifname="eth2">
  <mxCell style="…" vertex="1" parent="pg-node~sw1">
    <mxGeometry x="…" y="…" width="…" height="…" relative="1" as="geometry">
      <mxPoint x="…" y="…" as="offset"/>
    </mxGeometry>
  </mxCell>
</object>
```

A pill, a node icon and a node description have `relative="1"` geometry: `x` and `y` are a
fraction of the node's size and the offset is in px, so the cell stays on its face when a user
resizes the node. Along its face a pill keeps a fixed px distance from the nearer corner; a pill
centred on its face (within the export tolerance `EPS` in `src/render/drawio.ts`, 1e-6 px today) keeps the centre: fraction 0.5 and an offset of minus half its
length. The geometry is not part of the binding.

draw.io keeps the attributes when a user edits the diagram. Its _Edit Data_ dialog shows them. An
SVG or PNG export from draw.io keeps them only when it embeds the diagram XML.

## 2. Ids

Bind to `pg-id`, not to the cell `id`. A copy and paste in draw.io gives the cell a new `id` but
keeps `pg-id`. The cell `id` follows from `pg-id` and is for convenience only.

| Thing      | `pg-id`                                                                               | Cell `id`                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| node       | the YAML node id: `sw1`                                                               | `pg-node~sw1`                                                          |
| port       | `<node>:<port>`: `sw1:eth2`; `<node>:<port>#<n>` for the n-th port of one name, n > 1 | `pg-port~sw1~eth2~1`                                                   |
| link       | see section 2.1                                                                       | `pg-link~<link id>`; `pg-link~<link id>~<i>` for run i of a split link |
| link label | — (the cell has `pg-of`)                                                              | `pg-linkLabel~<link id>`                                               |
| node icon  | — (the cell has `pg-of`)                                                              | `pg-icon~<node>`                                                       |

In a cell `id`, the separator is `~`. The export writes a `%` or a `~` inside a part as `%25` or
`%7e`, so two different things cannot get the same cell `id`.

### 2.1 Link ids

1. A link with `id:` in the YAML has that id.
2. Any other link has `<from>-><to>`, in YAML direction. An end is:
   - `<node>:<port>` for a named port (`<node>:<port>#<n>` when n > 1),
   - `<node>` for an anonymous port (the YAML end names a node and no port),
   - `<group>` for a group end.
3. When that id is already used, the link gets `<from>-><to>@<k>`, with the smallest free k from 2.
   Rule 2 goes through the links in YAML order.

An end never contains `>` or `@`, and a YAML id never contains `:`, `>` or `@`. Thus an id from
rule 1 never equals an id from rule 2, and two links with different ends never get the same id.
In the XML file, `>` is written `&gt;`. An XML parser gives it back as `>`.

Examples: `sw1:eth2->srv1:eth0`, `router->isp` (two anonymous ports), `router->isp@2` (a second,
parallel link).

The id does not change when you reorder the links. It changes when an end of the link changes.
Some ids can still move:

- `@k` follows YAML order. When you move a parallel link before another link with the same ends,
  the two links exchange their ids.
- The YAML ends `node.port` (a port name used more than once) and `node.*` select a port in link
  order. A reorder can change the selected port, and with it the id.

Give a link an `id:` when a dashboard must bind to it through such changes.

## 3. Attributes

All attribute values are strings. A reader must parse numbers and booleans.

| Attribute   | On                                   | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

A link from `pg-from` to `pg-to` has the YAML direction. Use it to select the counter for each
direction, for example the transmit counter of the `pg-from` port.

`pg-from` and `pg-to` name a port cell only when the end is a named port. An anonymous port has no
cell, and the link ends on the node cell.

A link end is pinned to its visible end (`visibleEnd`, D-Q7), a point of the path: on a port that
draws a pill, the first point where the path leaves the pill (its outward face on the stem, or the
stem end when the stem is shorter than the pill's half depth), or the approach point on the pill's
tangential edge for an end on an approach; on an anonymous port, the path end on the node cell. The interior waypoints
are the published path. `edgeStyle` follows that polyline: `none` for a run with no bend,
`orthogonalEdgeStyle` for a square run, and `none` for a run with a diagonal.

### 3.1 Labels

A link label is in one of two places:

- the `label` attribute of the link `<object>` itself, or
- a separate cell with `pg-kind="link-label"` and `pg-of="<link id>"`. This cell is a child of the
  link run that it stands on.

To find the label of a link, look for a `link-label` cell with its `pg-of` first. If there is no
such cell, use the `label` of the link object. A split link carries its label on one run only.

The labels are plain text: the style has no `html` key, and a label of more than one line has its
lines one newline (`&#10;`) apart. An SVG export of the file draws each line as a native `<text>`,
not as a `<foreignObject>` with a PNG fallback. The export does not set `placeholders`, so draw.io
shows a `%name%` in a label as it is.

Label placement is a render option (`--labels`). `on-run`, the default, centres a link label on the
segment that supports it and fills the label with the backdrop. It moves a label only, never a route.
`measured` keeps the box stage 9 placed, beside its run, as the SVG draws it. Use `measured` to verify
an export against the layout model: every label then decodes to its measured centre.

A node's `label` is its name only. Plain text has one font per cell, so a node's description is a
separate, unbound text cell (`pg-nodeDescription~<node>`), a child of the node cell.

## 4. Author metadata

The YAML `meta:` map on a node, on a port (map form) and on a link becomes attributes of that
cell. The root `meta:` becomes attributes of the root cell (`id="0"`).

```yaml
meta: { datasource: victoriametrics }
nodes:
  sw1:
    group: core
    meta: { job: node-sw1, instance: sw1 }
    ports:
      - { name: eth2, meta: { ifname: eth2 } }
links:
  - from: sw1.eth2
    to: srv1.eth0
    id: sw1-uplink
    meta: { capacity: 1e9 }
```

Rules:

- A value is a string, a finite number or a boolean. The export writes it as a string. A number
  uses the JavaScript form: `1e9` becomes `1000000000`. A tab, a newline or a carriage return in a
  string is written as a character reference (`&#9;`, `&#10;`, `&#13;`), so a parser keeps it.
- A key starts with a letter or an underscore. It contains letters, digits, underscores or
  hyphens. The key goes into the attribute name with no prefix and no change.
- These keys are reserved, in any case: `id`, `label`, `placeholders`, all keys that start with
  `pg-`, and all keys that start with `xml`. The parser refuses them.
- The `pg-` attributes come first. The meta attributes come after them, in sorted key order.
- `tooltip` and `link` are not reserved. draw.io shows `tooltip` when the pointer is on the cell
  and makes the cell a hyperlink with `link`.
- The export also writes generated text into `tooltip`, as the SVG writes it in `<title>`: the full
  text of a shortened or omitted link label (on the link, or on the label cell), the members of a
  group-link fallback, and the tooltip of a mesh bus (on every piece of the bus; these pieces carry
  `tooltip` and no `pg-` attribute). draw.io shows `tooltip` as HTML: the generated text has `&`, `<`
  and `>` escaped, and an author `meta.tooltip` is written raw, so it may hold draw.io HTML. When a
  cell also has an author `meta.tooltip`, the author text comes first, then a new line, then the
  generated text. A reader that binds by `pg-kind` ignores a
  cell with no `pg-kind`.
- No cell inherits the root `meta:`. A reader can use it as a default for every cell.

Common keys for a network diagram: `host`, `job`, `instance`, `ifname`, `device`, `capacity`
(the link limit in bit/s), `kind`. portograph does not read them.

## 5. Not in version 1

These cells have no binding attributes:

- group and frame boxes,
- mesh bus bars, stubs, joints and risers (a mesh bus member link has no link cell),
- overlay end marks, icon tiles, node descriptions and the legend,
- the canvas background (layer `Canvas`),
- the count label of a merge bundle. Its cell id comes from the bundle number, which can change
  when you reorder the links.

A decoration (port mark, bus joint, icon tile) is locked to its owner: no move, resize, edit or connect on its own. Marks and joints
cannot be deleted alone, because link ends bind to them. A reader can ignore a locked cell with no `pg-kind`.

Known difference: draw.io draws plain text at its own line pitch, `round(size × 1.2)`, and has no
style to change it. The first baseline is within about 0.5 px (measured at 11 px). When the model pitch of a multi-line label differs,
its further lines can sit about 1 px a line off the SVG, and the export reports `DRAWIO_LINE_PITCH`.

## 6. Versioning

- `pg-schema` on the root cell gives the version.
- A new attribute or a new `pg-kind` value does not change the version. A reader must ignore an
  attribute or a kind that it does not know.
- A change to an id format or to the meaning of an attribute increments the version.
- `pg-rules` is reserved for binding rules on the root cell. The export does not write it yet, and
  `meta:` cannot set it, because all `pg-` keys are reserved. A reader must ignore it until a later
  version defines its content.
